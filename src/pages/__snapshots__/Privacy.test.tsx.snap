        We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for us. The use of our Internet pages is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject. The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled. As the controller, we have implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.

      </h3>
      <p
        class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1"
      >
        On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics(with the anonymizer function).Google Analytics is a web analytics service.Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites.A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come(the so - called referrer), which sub - pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub - page was viewed.Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost - benefit analysis of Internet advertising. The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland. For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application & quot; _gat._anonymizeIp & quot;.By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website.Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us. Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.The definition of cookies is explained above.With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website.With each call - up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google.During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements. The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject.With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America.These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America.Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties. The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs. In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such.For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add - on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpag... and install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons. Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en... and under http://www.google.com/analytic.... Google Analytics is further explained under the following Link https://www.google.com/analyti....

        The controller has integrated components of the LinkedIn Corporation on this website.LinkedIn is a web - based social network that enables users with existing business contacts to connect and to make new business contacts.Over 400 million registered people in more than 200 countries use LinkedIn.Thus, LinkedIn is currently the largest platform for business contacts and one of the most visited websites in the world. The operating company of LinkedIn is LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court Mountain View, CA 94043, UNITED STATES.For privacy matters outside of the UNITED STATES LinkedIn Ireland, Privacy Policy Issues, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland, is responsible. With each call - up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which a LinkedIn component(LinkedIn plug -in) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to the download of a display of the corresponding LinkedIn component of LinkedIn.Further information about the LinkedIn plug -in may be accessed under https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins. During the course of this technical procedure, LinkedIn gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject. If the data subject is logged in at the same time on LinkedIn, LinkedIn detects with every call - up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub - page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject.This information is collected through the LinkedIn component and associated with the respective LinkedIn account of the data subject.If the data subject clicks on one of the LinkedIn buttons integrated on our website, then LinkedIn assigns this information to the personal LinkedIn user account of the data subject and stores the personal data. LinkedIn receives information via the LinkedIn component that the data subject has visited our website, provided that the data subject is logged in at LinkedIn at the time of the call - up to our website.This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the LinkedIn button or not.If such a transmission of information to LinkedIn is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their LinkedIn account before a call - up to our website is made. LinkedIn provides under https://www.linkedin.com/psett... the possibility to unsubscribe from e-mail messages, SMS messages and targeted ads, as well as the ability to manage ad settings. LinkedIn also uses affiliates such as Eire, Google Analytics, BlueKai, DoubleClick, Nielsen, Comscore, Eloqua, and Lotame. The setting of such cookies may be denied under https://www.linkedin.com/legal.... The applicable privacy policy for LinkedIn is available under https://www.linkedin.com/legal....

        Art. 6(1) lit.a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit.b GDPR.The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre - contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit.c GDPR.In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit.d GDPR.Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.f GDPR.This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller(Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

        The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.

        We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law(e.g.tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions(e.g.information on the contractual partner).Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her.The non - provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact our Data Protection Officer.Our Data Protection Officer clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non - provision of the personal data.
